# Create OSIS ID feature for Text-Fabric

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to create a new Text-Fabric feature:

   - [osis_id](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/features/osis_id.html) Book name according to the OSIS (Open Scriptural Information Standard) ID.

The final feature file will be added to the package available at the [N1904addons](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/) repository.

## OSIS ID

Book name according to the OSIS (Open Scriptural Information Standard) ID.

According to [wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_Bibles](https://wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_Bibles#OSIS):

> OSIS is an XML Schema definition for Bibles and other Biblical research texts, which enables ministries and other organizations to collaborate more easily. Traditionally, these organizations have stored their documents in disparate, proprietary markups, making it difficult when they wish to share in service with each other. OSIS provides a common markup for multiple visions.
