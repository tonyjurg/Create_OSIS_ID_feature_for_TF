# Create OSIS ID feature for Text-Fabric

Small [Jupyter notebook](OSIS_ref.ipynb) to creating the OSIS ID feature for N1904-TF.

The build feature is part of the [N1904addons](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/).

## OSIS ID

Book name according to the OSIS (Open Scriptural Information Standard) ID.

According to [wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_Bibles](https://wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_Bibles#OSIS):

> OSIS is an XML Schema definition for Bibles and other Biblical research texts, which enables ministries and other organizations to collaborate more easily. Traditionally, these organizations have stored their documents in disparate, proprietary markups, making it difficult when they wish to share in service with each other. OSIS provides a common markup for multiple visions.

## Attribution and footnotes

OSIS information was obtained from:
> [OSIS resource index](https://ebible.org/osis/)

The Greek base text is from Nestle1904 Greek New Testament, edited by Eberhard Nestle, published in 1904 by the British and Foreign Bible Society:
> Nestle, Eberhard. Η Καινή Διαθήκη Novum Testamentum Graece (New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1904).
The 1913 reprint is available [here](https://archive.org/details/hkainediathekete00lond/), which was transcribed by [Diego Santos](https://sites.google.com/site/nestle1904/home). All this material is in Public domain.
